# KMPG_AU_Data_Analytics_Consulting

This repository contains my solutions and project work for the KPMG AU Data Analytics Virtual Internship offered by Forage.

### Project Overview

Sprocket Central Pty Ltd , a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organisation, has approached Tony Smith (Partner) in KPMG’s Lighthouse & Innovation Team. Sprocket Central Pty Ltd  is keen to learn more about KPMG’s expertise in its Analytics, Information & Modelling team. 

Smith discusses KPMG’s expertise in this space (you can read more here). In particular, he speaks about how the team can effectively analyse the datasets to help Sprocket Central Pty Ltd grow its business.

Primarily, Sprocket Central Pty Ltd needs help with its customer and transactions data. The organisation has a large dataset relating to its customers, but their team is unsure how to effectively analyse it to help optimise its marketing strategy. 

However, in order to support the analysis, you speak to the Associate Director for some ideas and she advised that “the importance of optimising the quality of customer datasets cannot be underestimated. The better the quality of the dataset, the better chance you will be able to use it drive company growth.”

The client provided KPMG with 3 datasets:

Customer Demographic 
Customer Addresses
Transactions data in the past 3 months


### This repository is organized as follows:

- Data Quality Assessment: This directory contains the dataset provided for the internship project, a .ipynb file containing the code used to review the data quality and a .pdf as the email for solution for the first task with all the issues identified on the the data and recommendations going forward to mitigate current data quality concerns as well.
- Data Analytics Approach : This directory contains a .pdf with the presentation for the customer that contain a suggestion of a framework to be used when conducting this project to optimise resource allocation for targeted marketing by focusing on high value customers.
- Data Insights and Presentation: This directory includes the visualizations and the dashboards created during the internship in .twbx format made with PowerBI along with the xlsx files of current and target customers for data analysis.
