# KMPG AU Data Analytics Consulting

Welcome to my repository, where I've documented my work and solutions for the KPMG AU Data Analytics Virtual Internship offered by Forage. This internship focuses on providing data-driven solutions to Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a medium-sized bikes and cycling accessories organization. In this repository, you'll find my contributions to this project.

## Project Overview

Sprocket Central Pty Ltd has partnered with KPMG's Lighthouse & Innovation Team, led by Tony Smith, to explore KPMG's expertise in analytics, information, and modeling. This collaboration aims to leverage data analysis to drive growth for Sprocket Central Pty Ltd.

The primary challenge faced by Sprocket Central Pty Ltd involves effectively analyzing their customer and transaction data to optimize their marketing strategy. While the organization possesses a substantial dataset related to its customers, they need guidance on how to analyze it effectively.

To support this analysis, the Associate Director stressed the critical importance of data quality, emphasizing that the better the quality of the dataset, the greater the potential for driving company growth.

The client has provided KPMG with three datasets:

1. Customer Demographic
2. Customer Addresses
3. Transaction data from the past three months

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized as follows:

- **Data Quality Assessment**: This directory contains the dataset provided for the internship project. It includes a Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) that contains the code used to review the data quality. Additionally, there is a PDF file that presents the email solution for the first task, highlighting data issues and recommendations for improving data quality.

- **Data Analytics Approach**: In this directory, you'll find a PDF presentation outlining a suggested framework for the project. This framework aims to optimize resource allocation for targeted marketing by focusing on high-value customers.

- **Data Insights and Presentation**: This directory includes visualizations and dashboards created during the internship. These are provided in .twbx format, created with PowerBI. The directory also contains XLSX files that include information on current and target customers for data analysis.
